    <p>In many cloud-based software development projects, a CI/CD process is designed and maintained for deploying applications in an efficient, safe, and productive manner to cloud environments.</p>
<p>The main focus around the CI/CD process is often on the cloud/remote side, but seldom we talk about the phase that comes right before CI/CD, which is the local development and testing done on the developer‚Äôs laptop.</p>
<p>In this article, I‚Äôll show why many common methods for local development are <strong>far from ideal</strong>, and I‚Äôll present a demo for an alternate, cloud-native approach which will improve your (or your developers‚Äô) productivity. üå§</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/12032/0*uOwC8XfHT4_yAex9" alt="Photo by Christina @ wocintechchat.com on Unsplash"></p>
<h2 id="-local-development">üë®üèº‚Äçüíª Local Development</h2>
<p>While there is not a one-size-fits-all best practice ‚Äî and it varies by the organization/project requirements and needs ‚Äî I would say the typical CI/CD flow looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5594/1*91ycDZVuHY0R_qqZKcmcVA.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs examine what comes <em>right</em> before step #1: Local Development.</p>
<p>In most cases, this gets done on the developer‚Äôs machine. That is, planning, designing, writing code, writing tests, running tests, and perhaps a POC ‚Äî and in some cases, manually making sure things are working as expected.</p>
<p>Many development projects are heavily invested in local setups that mimic the cloud environment in order to test whether the new feature/fix you introduce works properly ‚Äî without causing regression for other features and logic.</p>
<p>This kind of setup is mainly used to run certain kinds of automated tests (such as system tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests). Heck, if you want, you can even manual test üòè.</p>
<p>Additionally, local environments are often used to debug your code. Some developers are firm adopters of what I call ‚Äú<strong>debug-driven development</strong>‚Äù, but it can be more than just that. Debugging can be useful when you want to investigate a tough bug or better understand a complex flow.</p>
<h3 id="common-methods-for-local-development">Common Methods For Local Development</h3>
<p>Assume you‚Äôre working on a project which involves a bunch of microservices that are deployed to Kubernetes. Here are a couple of common industry methods that I‚Äôve witnessed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Docker-compose Method</strong>: Writing and maintaining docker-compose manifests (which are some sort of a duplicate of the existing K8s YAML manifests) that bring up your services + 3rd party dependencies for local testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Local K8s Method: **Running a local Kubernetes cluster using minikube/k3s/kind/other, and deploying your services locally for testing, combined with a bunch of scripts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Test Suites Method: **Makefiles/bash scripts that start a per-service integration tests suites, where 3rd party dependencies are being launched locally as containers via Docker (<a href="https://github.com/ory/dockertest">dockertest</a> for example, is a popular choice for such a setup).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all possible options for how to run and test your application locally.</p>
<h3 id="disadvantages-of-common-local-development-methods">Disadvantages of common local development methods</h3>
<p>However, the methods mentioned above come with a few disadvantages as well, including:</p>
<p><strong>Lack of local support from 3rd-parties</strong></p>
<p>There are some 3rd-party cloud dependencies that do not offer a way to run locally. In some cases, you can emulate by ‚Äú<a href="https://blog.pragmatists.com/test-doubles-fakes-mocks-and-stubs-1a7491dfa3da">mocking/stubbing</a>‚Äù the 3rd-party APIs, but that requires a lot of work maintaining it and does not truly represent the reality. It‚Äôs a kind of cheat. What if, for example, one of your DB queries is faulty. How can you figure that out through your testing/debugging if you are not ‚Äútalking‚Äù to a real DB instance?</p>
<p><strong>Resource-heavy issues</strong></p>
<p>If your application is heavy in terms of resources, your laptop may not be up to the task. For example, you run a stress test to reproduce a memory leak bug. Or, for example, a bug is only reproduced when there are 20 replicas of your application running simultaneously. Eventually, you find out your laptop is getting unresponsive üòÖ. This hurts productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Shutdowns while debugging</strong></p>
<p>If you want to test or debug a tough/rare bug, which may happen once every few days, your local machine might go shutdown/sleep/hibernate, forcing you to start all over again.</p>
<p><strong>No single source of truth</strong></p>
<p>In the <strong>Docker-compose Method</strong>, you find yourself violating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth">‚Äúsingle source of truth</a>‚Äù principle by maintaining multiple representations of your environments.</p>
<p><strong>Running integration tests ‚â† actual integration</strong></p>
<p>In the **Test Suites Method, **while running integration tests is a good practice with a lot of benefits (even when running locally), it still isn‚Äôt the same as integrating your change on a real cloud environment. In some cases, there are integration/deployment bugs and failures it might not detect (such as network connectivity issues to other services, configuration issues, boot crashes, etc.)</p>
<p>The disadvantages described above hurt your development experience by making you less productive. And in many cases, they do not reflect reality (A classic case of ‚Äú<a href="https://hackernoon.com/it-works-on-my-machine-f7a1e3d90c63">*It works on my machine!</a>‚Äù) <em>and by that, they bring little value</em>.*</p>
<p>Is there a better, more modern way of approaching the local development phase, while improving productivity and usability? Yes, yes there is.</p>
<h2 id="-cloud-native-developer-environments">‚òÅÔ∏è <em><strong>Cloud-Native Developer Environments</strong></em></h2>
<p>Now let‚Äôs explore remote, cloud-native environments.</p>
<p>By transforming your local environment into a remote environment, the issues above don‚Äôt exist. Plus, it‚Äôll upgrade your development experience into a modern, reliable, cloud-native experience.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-cloud-native-developer-environments-work">How do cloud-native developer environments work?</h3>
<p>Allocate a <strong>separate</strong> cloud environment <strong>for each</strong> of your developers, which is a replica (not quite, but close enough) of your development/production environments.</p>
<p>By using a cloud-native personal environment approach, each developer on a team has the autonomy to use their environment as they see fit. Whether it&rsquo;s for testing new features and bug fixes, reproducing bugs, or even tinkering for self-learning. All done in an environment very similar to production. ‚úåÔ∏è</p>
<p>You could then adapt your tooling around this to make these environments more valuable by, for example, running manual/automated tests, ‚Äúmirroring‚Äù traffic from production towards the personal environments, etc.</p>
<p>Another valuable thing that comes to mind is conducting live, remote debugging in these environments, in complete isolation without interfering with other environments. You can make use of existing off-the-shelf tooling built for this purpose (we‚Äôll see an example of such a tool in the next chapter).</p>
<h3 id="winning-points-for-productivity-maintainability-and-reliability">Winning Points For Productivity, Maintainability, And Reliability</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why you should switch to cloud-native dev environments, but I‚Äôll share my top eight.</p>
<p>You Will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Re-use your existing K8s YAML manifests, without having to maintain duplicate deployment configurations. (Keeping it DRY üåµ)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deploy to a cloud environment is done the same way as you deploy to dev/prod, but with added isolation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop relying on your local hardware. Cloud infra can easily scale up if you want to run tests that demand heavy resources and scale down on the weekend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launch long-running tests in your environment without the fear of your laptop shutting down or going into hibernate mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detect integration issues quickly, since you‚Äôre using real cloud service APIs, and not mocks (for example, you can communicate with PubSub, Cloud SQL, Datastore, and many other cloud services).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take advantage of the built-in infrastructure that the cloud offers for monitoring, alerting, profiling, tracing, and log aggregation, just as you benefit from it for production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save time by not having to run fancy setup scripts all the time. The cloud is rapid. Your environment is ready for you when you need it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use these environments to learn Kubernetes by practice (if you‚Äôre a beginner), without affecting other environments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally ‚Äî in addition to developers ‚Äî DevOps/SRE engineers can benefit from a personal environment by running infra configuration changes on their environment, before hitting environments shared by others.</p>
<h2 id="-hi-i-have-a-question">üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hi! I Have a Question!</h2>
<h3 id="will-my-cloud-bill-explode"><em><strong>Will my cloud bill explode?</strong></em></h3>
<p>The initial thought is to provision an entirely separate independent replica of your cloud instances for each developer, isolated by projects, where each project contains a replica of your infrastructure.</p>
<p>This is generally a good practice. Especially security-wise, as it provides good isolation. However, the cost of this approach can become a problem, especially as your company/team scales.</p>
<p>Since we are talking about development environments, which are isolated from the production environment in many cases, you can make the tradeoff of costs over security.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Side-note: This tradeoff between security and costs varies between different organizations and requirements ‚Äî make sure you understand the implications. This <a href="https://gkesecurity.guide/project_organization/">GKE Security guide</a> can help you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>So, how do we make that tradeoff?</strong></em> You can make use of multi-tenant features of your cloud services in order to save costs by <strong>sharing resources between environments</strong>.</p>
<p>This is often called ‚ÄúSoft Multi-Tenancy‚Äù, whereby ‚ÄúSoft‚Äù you limit the risk by allowing multiple users from the same ‚Äútrusted‚Äù organization to share the resources.</p>
<p>For example, all developers in a team working on an application can share a K8s cluster, where each developer has the entire application stack replicated in its own K8s namespace.</p>
<p>Another example is that all developers can share a single DB instance, where each developer will have a dedicated DB user, schema, and tables.</p>
<p>This is the approach we are going to demo, in the next chapter.</p>
<h3 id="is-this-a-pain-to-set-up-and-maintain-"><em>Is this a pain to set up and maintain? ü§ïü•∏</em></h3>
<p>Not really! You can (and should) make it automated and easily reproducible with Infrastructure as Code and GitOps principles.</p>
<p>Once all of this configuration is described as code, creating/destroying a personal environment is a matter of a few clicks. Less room for human error as well, as the process is automated.</p>
<h3 id="why-isnt-it-in-the-development-environment-scope-">Why isn‚Äôt it in the development environment scope? ü§î</h3>
<p>The classic development environment isn‚Äôt isolated. It‚Äôs shared between all the developers. You merge your code, and your friend merges their code at the same time, so it‚Äôs essentially a melting pot. It‚Äôs not feasible debugging and running experiments in a shared environment once your team grows.</p>
<p>In addition, The development environment stage is a bit too late. You have already created a PR, you passed the code review, you merged the PR. Now you discover your changes immediately crash the service. This is now considered a blocker and requires a revert/rollback/hotfix. It is time-consuming for you and your fellow developers.</p>
<h3 id="personal-environments-or-ephemeral-environments-">Personal environments or ephemeral environments? üëÄ</h3>
<p>The simple answer is that it‚Äôs up to you.</p>
<p>Basically, with personal environments, you are dedicating an environment for a specific person for a long-term purpose. While with ephemeral environments, you are creating an environment for a specific <strong>change</strong> (which gets destroyed after you merge that change).</p>
<p>My colleague Mike Sparr wrote a great <a href="https://blog.doit-intl.com/recreating-heroku-ci-cd-review-apps-on-google-cloud-platform-845fa0957232?source=friends_link&amp;sk=f84712c1579d96be64edd4ceb6f2ff2f">article</a> on ephemeral environments and you should check that out as well.</p>
<p>You could definitely do both ‚Äî though that might be an overkill for your needs.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.doit-intl.com/heading-towards-cloud-native-developer-environments-part-2-how-51b09f70c7fa">Part 2</a>, I will illustrate such a setup using an example architecture, using Terraform, ArgoCD, and Telepresence. <a href="https://blog.doit-intl.com/heading-towards-cloud-native-developer-environments-part-2-how-51b09f70c7fa">Go to Part 2!</a></p>

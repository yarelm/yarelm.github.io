    <p>The engineers most resistant to AI are often your most senior. They&rsquo;re also the ones you need to win over first.</p>
<p>You probably believe that AI is a huge productivity boost for engineers. And that engineers who do not adopt AI will find themselves with a huge disadvantage in the near future, or even out of job.</p>
<p>Why is that claim not enough to move the needle?</p>
<p>Because productivity claims don&rsquo;t address what skeptics actually care about: quality and maintainability.</p>
<p>In every org, there are the &ldquo;<strong>AI skeptical</strong>&rdquo; engineers.</p>
<p>These are usually the more senior folks, and often those that tend to be more technical than others.</p>
<p>They are the ones who&rsquo;ve already seen phases of hype over their careers, and they developed a mature level of skepticism. They say AI is too hyped.</p>
<p>While at the same time, you may see the PMs, the designers, the analysts and other non-engineers in the org, swiftly adopt AI and use vibe-coding heavily, while being deeply passionate about it. What&rsquo;s going on? Shouldn&rsquo;t the engineering be the pioneers of new technology?</p>
<p>To get your engineering team to be AI-first, you have to <strong>win them over</strong>. Because those AI skeptics are often the more senior engineers, they tend to lead and influence where the wind is blowing within their teams. If you make them AI-first, others will follow.</p>
<p>As a manager, you may think &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t want to use AI because they are afraid it will replace them&rdquo;, or other similar thoughts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mostly not true. And as a technical skeptical person myself, I can understand why they developed that skepticism. To win them over, you need to understand their point of view.</p>
<h2 id="why-theyre-skeptical">Why They&rsquo;re Skeptical</h2>
<p>Imagine the process they have gone through that reinforced their skepticism:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They played with vibe-coding a few times, and it ended up as a big ball of mud. They know the meaning of it - it&rsquo;s not maintainable over time, and it&rsquo;s a tech debt factory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their LinkedIn feed is filled with non-technical influencers who keep bragging about AI (&ldquo;I made a website in 5 minutes, it&rsquo;s the end of software engineering&rdquo;, &ldquo;I can do everything with n8n, no-code for the win&rdquo;). But these people never owned production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI-slop is everywhere. They become very picky and defensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine the effort they make everyday to keep the quality bar high. And then, someone, maybe a non-technical folk, is handing them a vibe-coded PR with 200 files changed, and asking them to deploy it or make it &ldquo;production-ready&rdquo;. They know it&rsquo;s a ticking time-bomb. They know that if they take ownership of that, they invite chaos.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They are not wrong there. These skeptical folks have some good points, because they <strong>care deeply about production and high-quality</strong>, they want to keep the tech reliable and working so that the <strong>business will grow and prosper</strong>.
They know the devil is in the details, and the concerning things that they see can&rsquo;t always be seen clearly from up above.</p>
<p>But they are wrong in allowing the skepticism to control them, preventing them from adopting AI that will allow them to be more productive.</p>
<h2 id="what-worked-for-me">What Worked for Me</h2>
<p>I was building AI agents at the time, so I had a sense of the potential. I forced myself to stop writing code manually for a while and lean fully on AI. It was clunky at first, and the results were not up to my standards. But after a period of experimenting, I noticed I was genuinely more productive. The key insight: AI-generated code is verifiable, so you can verify the logic works. But once you put a senior engineer in the loop, you can make it more controllable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I started treating AI as a <strong>copilot that helps me brainstorm, plan, and execute on my terms</strong>—and it stuck. But I needed that trial and error period to get there. Once other engineers noticed that, they followed.</p>
<p>When I was working with teams to help them adopt AI-assisted coding, that skeptical pattern became clear to me, and I knew how to approach them because I can speak their language and understand their concerns. And that builds trust.</p>
<h2 id="winning-over-your-skeptics">Winning Over Your Skeptics</h2>
<h3 id="-dont">❌ Don&rsquo;t</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t call AI coding as vibe-coding. Terminology can trigger emotions. Vibe-coding is when the code doesn&rsquo;t matter. Not every AI coding is vibe coding. There are much safer and reliable ways to do AI coding for production. You can call it AI-assisted coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t dismiss the skeptical. Listen to them and understand their perspective, give them time, but challenge them, because they must adapt to the new world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t allow non-engineers to hand over vibe-coded solutions and expect engineers to deploy them to production. Make it clear: vibe-coded work is for POCs and reference only. Engineers who own production systems shouldn&rsquo;t be bypassed. This is exactly the kind of thing that reinforces your skeptics&rsquo; distrust—and proves them right.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="-do">✅ Do</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find skeptical engineers who&rsquo;ve become passionate AI adopters—people respected by their peers. Let them lead this effort while you sponsor and support them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to team leads to give engineers time to learn and experiment. AI-assisted coding is not vibe-coding—it&rsquo;s a skill that takes time to develop. Expect an initial dip in productivity before you see the gains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop healthy skepticism yourself. When someone shows you a sexy demo built using AI in a few hours, dig deeper—ask the skeptics what&rsquo;s rotting under the hood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start having forums, guilds, and discussions about AI safety - Listen to the people in the trenches - What concerns them? How do we keep our quality bar high while using AI? How do we adapt the SDLC to fit AI? How do we do proper code reviews for AI-generated code?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>The AI-first transformation requires both top-down and bottom-up—leadership support <em>and</em> buy-in from the people closest to the code. Neither alone is enough. As a manager, you&rsquo;re the bridge—and your skeptics are the first ones to bring across. Win them, and you win the team.</p>

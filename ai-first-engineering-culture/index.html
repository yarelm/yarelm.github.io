    <p>The engineers most resistant to AI are often your most senior. They&rsquo;re also the ones you need to win over first.</p>
<p>You probably believe that AI is a huge productivity boost for engineers. And that engineers who do not adopt AI will find themselves with a huge disadvantage in the near future, or even out of job.</p>
<p>You have a really valid point there. But why is that claim not enough to move the needle?</p>
<p>In every org, there are the &ldquo;<strong>AI skeptical</strong>&rdquo; engineers.</p>
<p>These are usually the more senior folks, and those that tend to be more technical than others.</p>
<p>They are the ones who&rsquo;ve seen many phases of hype over their careers, and they developed a mature level of skepticism. They say AI is too hyped.</p>
<p>To get your engineering team to be AI-first, you have to <strong>win them over</strong>. Because these skeptics are often the more senior folks, they tend to lead and influence where the wind is blowing within their teams. If you make them AI-first, others will follow.</p>
<p>As a manager, you may think &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t want to use AI because they are afraid it will replace them&rdquo;, or other similar thoughts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mostly not true. I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of them, and as a technical skeptical person myself, I can understand why they developed that skepticism. To win them over, you need to understand their way of thinking.</p>
<h3 id="why-theyre-skeptical">Why They&rsquo;re Skeptical</h3>
<p>Imagine the process they have gone through that reinforced their skepticism:</p>
<ul>
<li>They played with vibe-coding a few times, and it ended up as a big ball of mud. They know the meaning of it - they can&rsquo;t maintain it over time, and it&rsquo;s a tech debt factory.</li>
<li>All of their LinkedIn feed is filled with non-technical influencers who keep bragging about AI (&ldquo;I made a website in 5 minutes, it&rsquo;s the end of software engineering&rdquo;, &ldquo;I can do everything with n8n, no-code for the win&rdquo;)</li>
<li>AI-slop is everywhere.</li>
<li>Some of them may have already handed over vibe-coded code built in 2 hours by non-technical folks asking them to make it &ldquo;production-ready&rdquo; and they know that it&rsquo;s a ticking time-bomb. They know that if they take ownership of that, they invite chaos.</li>
</ul>
<p>They are not wrong there. These skeptical folks have some good points, because they <strong>care about production and high-quality</strong>, they want to keep the tech reliable and working so that the <strong>business will prosper</strong>.
They know the devil is in the details, and the concerning things that they see can&rsquo;t always be seen from up above.</p>
<p>But they are wrong in allowing the skepticism to control them, preventing them from adopting AI and gaining productivity boost.</p>
<p>So how do you actually move them? I can share what worked for me.</p>
<p>I was never a big coding enthusiast; I cared more about architecture, and coding was just a tool. Around the same time, I was building AI agents, so I understood the potential.</p>
<p>I forced myself to stop writing code manually for a while and lean fully on AI. It was clunky at first, but after a period of experimenting, I noticed I was genuinely more productive. The key insight: AI-generated code is verifiable. Once you put a senior engineer in the loop, it becomes controllable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I started treating AI as a <strong>copilot that helps me brainstorm, plan, and execute on my terms</strong>—and it stuck. But I needed that trial and error period to get there.</p>
<p>When I was working with teams to help them adopt AI-assisted coding, that skeptical pattern became clear to me, and I knew how to approach them because I can speak their language and see them eye-to-eye. And that builds trust.</p>
<h2 id="tips-on-ai-coding-enablement">Tips on AI-coding enablement</h2>
<h3 id="-do">✅ Do</h3>
<ol>
<li>Find skeptical engineers who&rsquo;ve become passionate AI adopters—people respected by their peers. Let them lead this effort while you sponsor and support them.</li>
<li>Talk to team leads to give engineers time to learn and experiment. AI-assisted coding is not vibe-coding—it&rsquo;s a skill that takes time to develop. Expect a productivity plateau before you see the gains.</li>
<li>Develop healthy skepticism yourself. When someone shows you a sexy demo built using AI in a few hours, dig deeper—ask the skeptics what&rsquo;s rotting under the hood.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="-dont">❌ Don&rsquo;t</h3>
<ol>
<li>Don&rsquo;t call AI coding as vibe-coding. Terminology can trigger emotions. Vibe-coding is when the code doesn&rsquo;t matter. Not every AI coding is vibe coding. There are much safer and reliable ways to do AI coding for production. You can call it AI-assisted coding.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t dismiss the skeptical. Listen to them and understand their perspective, give them time, but challenge them, because they must adapt to the new world.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t allow non-engineers to hand over vibe-coded solutions and expect engineers to deploy them to production. Make it clear: vibe-coded work is for POCs and reference only. Engineers who own production systems shouldn&rsquo;t be bypassed. This is exactly the kind of thing that reinforces your skeptics&rsquo; distrust—and proves them right.</li>
</ol>
<p>🎯 The AI-first transformation requires both top-down and bottom-up—leadership support <em>and</em> buy-in from the people closest to the code. Neither alone is enough. As a manager, you&rsquo;re the bridge—and your skeptics are the first ones to bring across. Win them, and you win the team.</p>
